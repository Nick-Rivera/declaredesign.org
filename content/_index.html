<h1>Declaring and Diagnosing Research Designs</h1>
<p>Empirical social scientists routinely face two research design problems. First, we need to select
a high-quality design, given resource constraints. Second, we need to convince readers and
reviewers of the design’s high quality.</p>
<p>We describe in this Web site an approach to <em>declaring</em> the elements of a research design in
code and <em>diagnosing</em> the properties of the design, such as power and sampling bias, given
assumptions. <a href="/idea/">The Idea</a> outlines the approach, with further details in our <a href="/paper.pdf">working paper</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="design-library" class="section level1">
<h1>Design Library</h1>
<p>To make getting started easy, we provide a <a href="/library/">library of common research designs</a> that you can
diagnose, modify, and implement.</p>
</div>
<div id="software" class="section level1">
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>We provide four linked software packages to declare and diagnose research designs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="/R/randomizr/">randomizr</a>: Easy-to-use tools for common forms of random assignment and sampling.</li>
<li><a href="/R/fabricatr/">fabricatr</a>: Imagine your data before you collect it.</li>
<li><a href="/R/estimatr/">estimatr</a>: Fast estimators for design-based inference.</li>
<li><a href="/R/DeclareDesign/">DeclareDesign</a>: Declare and diagnose research designs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="/R/DeclareDesign/">Getting Started</a> guide for DeclareDesign provides an overview of
the capabilities of each package and how to declare and diagnose designs in our framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting Help</h1>
<p>If you get stuck, head to our <a href="http://discuss.declaredesign.org">help forum</a> where
we’ll be happy to assist with our software or coding your design.</p>
</div>
<div id="contributing" class="section level1">

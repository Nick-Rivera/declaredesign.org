# Declaring and Diagnosing Research Designs

Empirical social scientists routinely face two research design problems. First, we need to select
a high-quality design, given resource constraints. Second, we need to convince readers and
reviewers of the designâ€™s high quality. 

We describe in this Web site an approach to *declaring* the elements of a research design in 
code and *diagnosing* the properties of the design, such as power and sampling bias, given 
assumptions. [The Idea](/idea) outlines the approach, with further details in our [working paper](/paper.pdf).

# Design Library

To make getting started easy, we provide a library of common research designs that you can use, 
diagnose, and modify. The [Design Library](/library) includes written descriptions of designs
and the code used to declare and diagnose them.

# Software

We provide four linked software packages to declare and diagnose research designs.

1. [randomizr](/R/randomizr): Easy-to-use tools for common forms of random assignment and sampling.
2. [fabricatr](/R/fabricatr): Imagine your data before you collect it.
3. [estimatr](/R/estimatr): Fast estimators for design-based inference.
4. [DeclareDesign](/R/DeclareDesign): Declare and diagnose research designs.

The [Getting Started](/R/DeclareDesign) guide for DeclareDesign provides an overview of
the capabilities of each package and how to declare and diagnose designs in our framework.

# Getting help

If you get stuck, we encourage you to head over to our [help forum](http://discuss.declaredesign.org) where
we'll be happy to assist with our software or coding your design.

# Contributing

We  encourage you to contribute your research designs to our [design library](/library). 
You can submit bug reports and feature
requests through our [Github repositories](https://github.com/DeclareDesign). 
We ask that you agree to our [code of conduct](/conduct) when you contribute.

# Declaring and Diagnosing Research Designs

Empirical social scientists routinely face two research design problems. First, we need to select
a high-quality design, given resource constraints. Second, we need to convince readers and
reviewers of the designâ€™s high quality. 

We describe in this Web site an approach to *declaring* the elements of a research design in 
code and *diagnosing* the properties of the design, such as power and sampling bias, given 
assumptions. [The Idea](/idea/) outlines the approach, with further details in our [working paper](/paper.pdf).

# Design Library

To make getting started easy, we provide a [library of common research designs](/library/) that you can
diagnose, modify, and implement.

# Software

We provide four linked software packages to declare and diagnose research designs.

1. [randomizr](/R/randomizr/): Easy-to-use tools for common forms of random assignment and sampling.
2. [fabricatr](/R/fabricatr/): Imagine your data before you collect it.
3. [estimatr](/R/estimatr/): Fast estimators for design-based inference.
4. [DeclareDesign](/R/DeclareDesign/): Declare and diagnose research designs.

The [Getting Started](/R/DeclareDesign/) guide for DeclareDesign provides an overview of
the capabilities of each package and how to declare and diagnose designs in our framework.

# Getting Help

If you get stuck, head to our [help forum](http://discuss.declaredesign.org) where
we'll be happy to assist with our software or coding your design.

# Contributing

We  encourage you to contribute to our [design library](/library/), 
as well as to submit bug reports and feature requests as [Github](https://github.com/DeclareDesign) issues. 
We ask that you agree to our [code of conduct](/conduct/).

# Funding

We are grateful for major funding from the [Laura and John Arnold Foundation](http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/)
and seed funding from [EGAP -- Evidence in Governance and Politics](http://egap.org).
